# Lithology Patterns

This directory includes SVG versions of lithology patterns taken from the
Federal Geographic Data Committee Digital Cartographic Standard for Geologic
Map Symbolization (Doc. No. FGDC-STD-013-2006), available here:

https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/2006/11A02/

## Step to reproduce

The source EPS files were loaded in Adobe Illustrator (22.1) as a swatch
library and then exported:

- Window -> Swatches
- Import EPS into swatch library
- Select swatch in list
- Object -> Pattern -> Edit Pattern
- Select all, copy to clipboard
- Paste into text file (as SVG)

## Notes

Some exports resulted in an Illustrator message, and should be revisited:

> A clipping mask was created around the pattern tile bounds to preserve legacy
> pattern appearance.
> For best results, release the clipping mask when changing the tile size or
> editing art that overlaps the tile edge.
